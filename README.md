WARNING!

This is a pretty stable beta, but we should follow some rules, untill we fix everything:
  - avoid using non-latin and non-numeric symbols in fields
  - use Google Chrome as your browser

IMPORTANT!

To start, you log in using username = admin, password = admin to go to the page of technical administrator. There you can add new users and execute custom queries (very dangerous for system, shouldn't be done unless really needed).

To write new report you can use username = head, password = head. You will pe able to submit report.

To retrive data from DB as university administrator you can use username = ua, password = ua.
